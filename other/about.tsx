      <Description>
        I started this journey in 2018 when I was just 14 years old, I started
        learning PHP as a curiosity for programming. Later I learned some CSS &
        JS. My first project was a simple Note making app and a Quiz app.
        <br />
        <br />
        I continued learning more and more and started working on my side
        projects. Recently is the moment where I finally understood what I want
        to follow.
        <br />
        <br />
        Nowadays, I am building my big side project including Atmos & Space,
        trying to finish my last year at high school, and ready to kickstart my
        career in this industry.
